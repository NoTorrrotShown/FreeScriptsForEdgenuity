# FreeScriptsForEdgenuity

These are 4 scripts you could do for Edgenuity.

2 of them are completely free, and 2 are not. You should know that this information, if leaked to the public, will be ruined for these websites (well not one of them, anyways).

If you follow the steps correctly down below in the Youtube video, you will be able to make the scripts work correctly.

This will be the first version and will not be updated. However, I will make another version of this in another repository.
